This paper study the generalization issue of X-ray prediction task. It state the issue of generalization is not due to a shift in the images but instead a shift in the labels. It finds interesting discrepancies between performance and agreement where models which both achieve good performance disagree in their predictions as well as models which agree yet achieve poor performance.
