\section{PROGRAM AND DESIGN OF THE RESEARCH INVESTIGATION}
\label{sec:research-design}

\subsection{Objectives, Methodology and Research Plan}

\subsubsection{Objectives}
The main objective of this research is .......


\textbf{AIM 1 (RQ 1 \& RQ 5)}:\\*
Gain better understanding of radiologists classification pattern of CXR images through eye tracking data.And how radiologists perceive other eye tracking classification pattern from other radiologists. \\* 

\noindent
\textbf{AIM 2 (RQ 2 \& RQ 3 \& 4)}:\\*
 Create an explainable human centered multimodal deep learning architecture that supports prediction of lung diseases based on human classification patterns from eye tracking data and pupil dilations, and patients' clinical data.
\noindent


\textbf{AIM 3 (RQ 1 \& RQ 5 \& RQ 6)}:\\*
Design human-centred interactive explanations and interfaces based on probabilistic graphical models that allow medical practitioners to interact, ask questions, and learn the lung disease diagnosis through the explanations \\*


\subsubsection{Methodology}
%% Design science (LEON)
% Copy 

\subsubsection{Research Plan}
% say that we will do evaluation with the help of radiologist. (Interview with radiologists.) (Assess our model output.). (Evaluate our framework)
%% Make Chart

% Say !!! We already have an established research collaboration with an experience radiologist from the main hospital in Portugal (This will be the subject that evaluate the work in all stages.) !!!
